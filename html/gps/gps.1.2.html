<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
    Semantic tags help make a more useful div-type tag that also helps make HTML pages more accessible to people with disabilities. I see main, nav, header and footer as being most useful because they are elements that are likely to be on every page.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
    HTML pages are read from top to bottom, so first elements will load first, last will load last.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
    I learned how to create a snippet in this challenge, and I will definitely be using them in the future.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
    I had the most trouble with knowing how table layout works without seeing it as I work on it. I think the best way for me to get comfortable with this is more practice. -->
