1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
    The Linux design philosophy was designed with the concept that the user is computer literate, and revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing. Linux treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power.
    Two tenets that pair well together are "Small is beautiful" and "Each program does one thing well". The focus is on doing one thing well with each program, which results in a simple and fast program.
    Another tenet is "Choose portability over efficiency" which comes from the idea that portability can be far more efficient in the long run, using shell scripts rather than a program made in a compiled language. 

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
    A VPS is a virtual machine sold by a hosting service (like DigitalOcean used in the example video). 
    A few advantages of a VPS are as follows:
    - cost: since you are not using an entire server, the cost is much less.
    - performance: a VPS has higher performance than a shared server, and a little lower performance than a dedicated server.
    - security: since everything is an individual segregated server, each website gets its own OS and resources and is more difficult to invade.

3. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
    Root is the most powerful user on Linux, and any mistakes you make in your program have the freedom to do whatever you tell them - including unintended deletions. You do not usually need root for most tasks, and any malicious software can cause much more harm because it will have access to everything.
